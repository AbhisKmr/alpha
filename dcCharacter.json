		"details": "Bruce’s life wasn’t the only one that was changed with the squeeze of that gunman’s trigger. A family friend and faithful butler, whose father had served as the Waynes’ butler before him, Alfred took on the responsibility of raising young Bruce after the murder of his parents. Caring deeply for the Wayne family, Alfred knew that the best way to honor the legacy of Thomas and Martha Wayne was ensuring their son grew into the man they would have wanted. He tried to mold the angry, confused boy into a savvy businessman who would be well-suited to take over his father’s business. But Bruce had a far different way of honoring his parents in mind, and when he adopted the cowl, Alfred came along for the ride, tirelessly guarding his employer’s secret while providing some much-needed assistance. Whether it’s skilled technical support, medical aid or simply managing the complicated schedule that comes with being a business leader, nighttime vigilante and wealthy playboy—it’s all under the purview of Mr. Pennyworth. Driven by love and an unwavering sense of loyalty, Alfred nevertheless worries deeply about Bruce. He understands the importance of Batman to a city such as Gotham, but after a lifetime of raising Bruce, he still sees a young, scared boy where most see a hardened hero. And every night the bat-signal flashes across the city skyline is another night that boy will spend searching for a way to undo something that could never be undone. A search that Alfred realizes could very well lead to his end.",

		"details": "Waller pulled herself up from rough beginnings to serve her country as a covert agent before becoming Director of the Advanced Research Group for Uniting Superhumans (A.R.G.U.S.). In this role, she created a highly classified team of super-villains known as Task Force X. The members of this specialized covert team are forced to go on whatever assignments Waller deems will serve the greater good. Refuse and members learn that the risky missions aren’t the only reason the team’s commonly referred to as the Suicide Squad.As the Squad’s leader, Waller often acts coldly and doesn't hesitate to put the team in near-impossible situations. She doesn't follow any standardized moral guidebook but instead operates by her own rules. The missions she assigns to the team serve a higher purpose…in theory. Being compassionate isn't an asset in Waller's line of work, but acting without emotion means she's not always so different from the villains in the Squad. In leading them, Waller has to be careful not to become one of them. If it’s not already too late.",

Looking at the world around him, he saw corruption, social oppression and the suffering of everyday people—and saw the government doing nothing about it. Taking a cue from the Dark Knight, Machin studied martial arts and put his engineering abilities and knowledge of computer technology to use to become a vigilante himself: Anarky. Although he thinks of himself as a hero like Batman and believes anarchy would help the people help themselves, Batman views Anarky's methods and actions as childish and violent, and considers Anarky a public threat, plain and simple.Anarky uses his abilities to bring down any corporation or authoritative entity that he feels hurts and oppresses people. While he can throw a punch as well as anyone, he relies primarily on his thorough understanding of modern technology to defeat his foes along with the very essence of anarchy itself—surprise.",

He’s capable of consuming both antimatter and positive matter, making and unmaking matter at will, all while altering reality and augmenting his own powers. Commanding an army of “shadow demons,” destructive warriors of pure antimatter that are loyal only to him, the Anti-Monitor has single-handedly destroyed thousands of universes. He takes lives by the millions and very few can stand in his way. Those who have, including our greatest super heroes, have met defeat and even death. If you see the Anti-Monitor coming, turn and run, because you don’t have much time…",

And although his courage and decisive nature have proven him a true heir to Atlantis’s throne, the continual conflict between land and sea makes him a citizen of both—and at home in neither.",

However, his real power lays in his ability to create conflict and destruction wherever he goes. His mere presence alone is enough to cause riots and acts of violence—which is exactly what he wants.A villain by his very nature, Ares is a perpetual war machine—a constant, unswayable force that will always seek to incite discord and devastation.

A run of unfortunate events, including the Teen Titans disbanding, a break-up, and some struggles with Green Arrow, opened the door to a treacherous path for Roy.

Actually, it turns out there’s quite a bit of truth to it…if you’re talking about the Atom.A gifted physicist, Dr. Ray Palmer put his genius mind to good use by laboring tirelessly to help create a better world. His hard work led to advancements in matter compression and the discovery of white-dwarf star remnants on Earth. Creating a specialized, size-changing belt that houses a lens filled with star matter, Ray has the ability to shrink his size down to subatomic levels. This unique power inspired his heroic moniker and allows the Atom to handle things most other heroes can’t even see: viruses, parasites, nuclear reactions and beyond. Using phone, fiber-optic cables and even the bloodstreams of other heroes and villains, Ray can get wherever he needs to be at incredible speeds.The Atom is constantly learning and has become a leading mind in some of the most progressive areas of scientific thought and inquiry. This thirst for knowledge has made him the go-to hero when facing problems rooted in science, but it can sometimes cloud his judgment when the enemy is powered by the supernatural or motivated by something that seems irrational. Ray can tackle the world’s biggest quandaries and tiniest threats, but there’s one fight he always struggles with: accepting that some things in life just can’t be explained.",

One of the massacre’s few survivors, Atrocitus swore revenge against the Guardians. But despite his considerable strength, skill and efforts, he was captured and imprisoned by the Guardians as they hid their horrendous mistake from the universe.Locked away for years, all that kept him alive was his hatred, until at last it consumed him. Atrocitus harnessed the red energy of rage and through blood rituals forged a Power Battery, creating the Red Lantern Corps. With a veritable army at his command, Atrocitus seeks his revenge—intent on killing every last one of the Guardians and willing to cut down any force that stands in his path of vengeance.",

His epic battle with Batman in the historic -Knightfall- storyline where he broke Batman's back and his subsequent appearances in comics, film and animation have made him one of the Dark Knight's most popular and enduring adversaries. Fueled by the uber-steroid serum known as Venom, Bane's strength is matched only by his intelligence. A master planner and strategist, he devoted his life to proving himself as the best. However, his quest for supremacy puts him directly at odds with the Dark Knight, whom Bane sees as the human embodiment of the law and order responsible for his captivity and torture as a child. Intriguingly, despite this hatred, Bane holds a much greater sense of respect for Gotham's guardian than most of his fellow villains, seeing Batman as his only real equal. But that equality comes at a price. The same serum that gives the villain his greatest strength is also his greatest weakness. Bane has developed an intense drug-like addiction to Venom and if deprived will go into severe withdrawal that could eventually culminate in madness. But if this will ultimately prove to be his downfall, it certainly hasn't yet.",

But when her overprotective Dad forbids her from joining the force, her admiration of Batman leads her to rebel the way crime-fighting rebels do in Gotham City: by picking up the mantle of the Bat.An exceptional fighter and detective, Batgirl is also unparalleled in her computer skills. With a Utility Belt filled with Batarangs and her own Batcycle to speed her across the city, she pursues justice regardless of whether others—including Batman—wish her to. But Gotham’s criminals are a ruthless and maniacal lot, and every moment she risks her neck means dancing closer to death.",

		"details": "Millionaire Bruce Wayne was just a kid when he watched his parents get gunned down during a mugging in Gotham City. The crime would define his life, as he dedicated himself to becoming the world’s greatest weapon against crime—the Batman.Forget his Batarangs, Batmobile, or Utility Belt filled with high-tech weapons. Batman is the most feared superhero of all, because he’s pushed himself to the absolute pinnacle of human achievement. He’s a brilliant detective who’s mastered fighting techniques the world’s barely heard of. An Olympic-caliber athlete with a plan for every occasion, Batman’s seemingly always five steps ahead of his foes. But in his crusade against injustice, two questions always loom: How far will he go to protect the innocent, and will he sacrifice his humanity along the way?",

		"details": "Kate had a long history of overachievement. She was an exemplary pupil at the United States Military Academy, earning top marks and easily rising to the head of her class…until she was dismissed from the school for being gay. Kate received support at home from her colonel father, but she was angry and frustrated by the military’s actions. Disheartened, Kate lost direction and became caught up with late nights and partying. And then Batman intervened.As Batwoman, Kate combines her special operative training and deep sense of discipline to serve justice to criminals. In fact, of all of Batman’s allies, Batwoman may be the one who’s most like him. Her military training makes her a tough adversary in both armed and unarmed combat, her experiences have made her a strong opponent of injustice and her intelligence has led her to become a solid detective. However, she also shares the Dark Knight’s self-destructive tendencies when it comes to personal relationships. For her, the mission always comes first.",

		"details": "Beast Boy can transform into any animal he has seen—both in real life and in illustrations. Gorillas, rhinos, sharks and even dinosaurs are within his nimble reach. His powers allow him to alter his entire body mass, permitting him to morph into animals larger, smaller, lighter or heavier than himself. He can even radically alter his body structure to form beasts such as snakes, jellyfish or insects. While in animal form, Garfield retains his unusual skin coloration, however, he also gains the abilities of each animal, whether it’s the strength of a gorilla or the speed of a cheetah.Upbeat, flirtatious and a bit of a joker, Beast Boy retains an air of affability at almost all times. Quite a feat, considering the loss of his parents, his rough childhood under a foster father and the physical changes brought to his skin and hair color due to the serum. Although he often uses his humor to hide the emotional pain he suffered from these hardships, the bonds he’s formed with his fellow super heroes has lessened his pain, and he trusts and loves his friends completely.",

		"details": "Taken from her mother at an early age, Barda grew up on Apokolips in Granny Goodness's Orphanage where she was trained in the art of battle. Barda relished fighting and enjoyed besting anyone that challenged her. Her sheer power and unparalleled skills in combat quickly made her the most feared Apokoliptian warrior of all time—an incredible feat to accomplish on a world that bred the most terrifying, cruel and malicious fighters in the Multiverse. Barda's abilities and take-charge attitude even allowed her to become the leader of the Female Furies, a ferocious and powerful group of warriors who served as the personal guard to Apokolips's tyrannical ruler, Darkseid. Barda served Darkseid for many years—until she met Mister Miracle. The two fell in love and Barda began questioning Darkseid’s cruelty and totalitarian philosophy. Eventually, she fled to Earth, battling her way through the hordes of Apokolips and her former allies—defeating them all.Barda continues to share a close and romantic relationship with Mister Miracle, despite their contrasting personalities. Whereas Mister Miracle is more peaceful and kind, Barda loves to fight and relishes battle. She's the brawn to his brain, and as the more powerful of the two, tends to be very protective of him.As a New God, Barda possesses immense levels of enhanced strength, speed, agility, stamina and more. Barda is also a master of multiple forms of combat and an expert swordswoman, capable of fighting even Wonder Woman to a stand-still. Her height alone makes her one of the tallest and most intimidating heroes in the universe. Along with her physical capabilities, Barda wears Apokoliptian armor that enhances her impressive abilities and wields the Mega-Rod, which may look small but packs a punch that could level mountains. As a high-tech weapon, the Mega-Rod fires powerful concussive bolts, increases gravitational forces and allows Barda to instantaneously teleport herself and others great distances.",

		"details": "An imperfect clone of Superman, Bizarro possesses all of the hero's amazing abilities and none of his moral restraints. He stands for the exact opposite of everything Superman represents, a warped reflection of the Man of Steel's inherent heroism. The uncontrollable villain rampages through the world, causing mass devastation and destruction, his twisted perspective making him as committed to causing violence as Superman is to stopping it. His faulty logic, broken speech and backwards morality make him unable to see his actions as wrong. Instead, he whole-heartedly believes he is acting in the correct manner, and that it is the Man of Tomorrow who is committing the acts of villainy.Broken, but brutally violent and incredibly unpredictable, Bizarro is one of the world’s most dangerous threats—and a terrifying example of the destructive potential Superman holds.",

		"details": "Long ago, the council of wizards—powerful beings that held dominion over all magic in the world—chose the warrior Black Adam as their champion, granting him vast magical powers and abilities. However, that power only further skewed Adam's already maligned moral compass, and rather than use his newfound gifts to help others, he used it to dominate them.Adam turned against the wizards and after a brutal battle was imprisoned for thousands of years. But now he is free once more, and his insatiable quest to conquer the world, to control all magic, continues. The only thing that stands in his way is Shazam!, the new champion of magic—and Black Adam will do anything in his power to destroy him and assert his position as the true ruler of the world.Driven by a need to rule, incredibly arrogant and one of the most powerful beings on the planet, Black Adam lives by a simple creed: kneel at his feet or be crushed by his boot.",

		"details": "One of DC Universe's earliest super heroines, the Black Canary mantle has been worn by a few different women across decades of appearances in comics, cartoon, TV shows and video games—but none is better known than Dinah Laurel Lance. Inspired by her father and his career in the Gotham City Police Department, Dinah wasn't able to join the force, but she found a different way of following in his crime fighting footsteps—as a black-clad, street smart vigilante.Driven to protect the streets and keep citizens safe in whatever city she calls home, Dinah has a fighter's spirit and determination. Her ultrasonic scream isn't the only ability that sets her apart as Black Canary, but it is her verbal calling card. She wields the noise with precision to crumble objects and incapacitate foes. A devoted student of martial arts and other methods of hand-to-hand combat, she is now a master and teaches what she's learned to up-and-coming super heroes. Dinah uses her impressive skills alongside her frequent and sometimes romantic partner Green Arrow, and she has proven herself to be a team player on multiple occasions—having worked with the Justice League of America and led her own team of Gotham-based heroes, the Birds of Prey.",

		"details": "A ruthless treasure hunter and mercenary, the man known as Black Manta spent his days scavenging the unexplored depths of the ocean, discovering long lost relics and powerful mythical items, all while taking on various jobs to fund his passion. Until one particular job changed his life.Hired to bring back a sample of Arthur Curry's blood, Black Manta encountered the young Aquaman and his father while the two were out at sea. In the ensuing struggle, Aquaman's father suffered a heart attack that ultimately led to his death. Seeking revenge, Aquaman hunted down Black Manta—and accidentally killed his father in retaliation. Thus began a circle of vengeance that forever bonded hero and villain.Fueled by hate and utilizing a powerful suit of armor that allows him to breathe underwater, survive the incredible pressures of the ocean depths and fire deadly energy blasts through his mask, Black Manta seeks to destroy Aquaman and everything he holds dear.",

At home, he constantly wished he could do more to help his struggling family. But he got more responsibility than he ever dreamed possible the day an alien doomsday weapon known as the Blue Beetle scarab chose Jaime as its new guardian, gifting him with dangerous weaponry, full body armor and the power of flight.As if helming a weapon designed to force its wearer to conquer the planet wasn’t bad enough, his new power has quickly drawn a small army of equally powerful enemies that present a very real threat to Jaime and those he loves. But while tangling with Blood Beetle, La Dama and The Reach may not have been part of his plan, Jaime’s accepted that his powers can do a lot of good for his community and world…as long as he can keep his domineering new suit under control.",

		"details": "At least, it seemed that way to Michael Jon Carter. Born far in the future, Michael was a star quarterback before he was caught betting on his own games. His reputation ruined, he stole a power suit and journeyed to the past, where he branded himself Booster Gold and used his powers and his knowledge of our future to mold himself into a super hero. Michael sought the fame he once had as a star athlete, and his new identity brought sponsorships, endorsement deals and a verified Twitter account. But it also brought something else—responsibility.As a time-traveler, Booster Gold understands how delicate our timeline is, and he often finds himself protecting the timestream. But in the ultimate irony for a fame-seeker, no one can ever know it’s him. After all, if people find out what he’s doing, it could change history and threaten the timestream. It’s a responsibility that Booster Gold has come to take seriously, suggesting that there may be more driving this spotlight-loving hero than a simple quest for adoration. Even if he does spend as much time signing autographs as he does saving lives.",

		"details": "Cold, calculating, unfeeling and absolutely single-minded in his goals, the aptly nicknamed Collector of Worlds journeys across the universe gathering information and knowledge from every civilization he encounters. But enlightenment isn’t Brainiac’s goal. Instead, he seeks the superiority that comes with knowledge. But what power does knowledge truly hold if everyone can obtain it? While more benevolent minds might be content to learn and share new knowledge, when Brainiac encounters a new civilization, he captures and bottles entire cities full of people and technology as samples—before destroying the planet and moving on, leaving little more than rubble in his wake.Brainiac is vastly intelligent and driven by pure, unwavering logic. Superman must utilize all of his powers when battling against the villain and his army of robot drones, but any chance at defeating Brainiac requires brains as well as brawn…and outthinking, out-planning and outwitting one of the smartest beings in the universe is a task few heroes are up to.Brainiac's power and intelligence make him one of Superman’s most dangerous foes—both as a direct threat and as a constant reminder to the entire world of just how big a danger an alien presence can truly be.",

		"details": "During his childhood in Australia, Digger became adept at crafting boomerangs. At first, they were playthings, but later in life, he learned to enhance his boomerangs with incendiary or electrifying components. Digger’s skill with the device led to a job as a performer and boomerang promoter in the U.S., but he didn’t receive a warm welcome. Laughter from the audience made him resentful, so he took his bitterness and poured it into a life of crime, taking on the moniker of Captain Boomerang. Eventually, the law caught up with him, and Digger found himself looking at a life in prison. That is, of course, unless he joined the Suicide Squad for a chance at a pardon.It says a lot about your personality if the members of the Suicide Squad think you’re dysfunctional, and that’s probably one of the kinder words they’d use to describe Captain Boomerang. Selfish to the core, he doesn’t look out for his teammates. He’s rarely dependable and often annoying. And yet, to this day, he hasn’t been booted from the team…",

		"details": "Indeed, Selina Kyle has led many lives as the feline fatale Catwoman—but one thing remains the same: Whenever this cat crosses your path, she's equally likely to steal your heart as well as your wallet. Growing up an orphan in one of Gotham’s worst neighborhoods, Selina turned to a life of crime to not only keep herself alive but her friends as well. The vivacious villainess elevated cat burglary to an art form, stealing whatever may be necessary—and sometimes even more—to survive and protect those closest to her. Utilizing a cat mask and suit to steal from the city’s rich and corrupt, she's a master at hand-to-hand combat and acrobatics, stealthy as a ninja and an expert at breaking and entering. However, despite her burglarious nature and antagonistic origins, Catwoman walks a fine line between hero and villain. She balances precariously on the precipice of good and evil, of doing the wrong thing for the arguably right reasons. And as such, Selina doesn't look at the world in black and white, but shades of gray. Guided by her own strict—if not slightly skewed—moral compass, Selina sometimes serves as one of the Dark Knight's closest allies. Their flirtatious relationship and complicated feelings for one another constantly push both in directions neither thought possible...or are always comfortable with. Particularly since there always looms the possibility that one day Catwoman will take her crimes too far, and Batman will have no choice but to see her behind bars.",

Under his leadership, the GCPD has improved both in the public eye and in their record of successful arrests and incarcerations. However, Gotham is no ordinary city, and where others may have locked up an unsanctioned super hero like Batman for taking the law into his own hands, Gordon has chosen to support the Dark Knight, acknowledging the difference he makes. Gordon's cooperation with Batman has made a difference in a city once seen as being well past the point of saving, and it’s sent a message to criminals throughout Gotham—whether it’s at the hands of a badge or a Bat, you will see justice. Gordon is aware of the legal issues associated with his partnership with the Dark Knight. As such, he adopts a look the other way philosophy for most of Batman's activities. Whereas Batman works in darkness as Gotham's Dark Knight, Commissioner James Gordon is its knight in the spotlight—ever vigilant and open about his commitment and desire to do what is right to protect and serve the people of his city.",

But this apparent callousness masks an interesting truth about Constantine: If the fight against evil forces requires a willingness to sacrifice everything and everyone that you hold dear, then a hard attitude is likely necessary. Whether it’s due to a sense of self-loathing, a resistance to any sort of authority or a deeply hidden desire to do what’s right, Constantine is willing to make the hard choices…so that no one else has to.",

But if your voice belongs to an antisocial, student bookworm complaining about getting to chemistry class on time, you’re probably the combustible hero known as Firestorm.When it comes to personalities, Ronnie Raymond and Jason Rusch are on opposite ends of the figurative periodic table. Ronnie’s a good-looking athlete with a quick-to-action attitude and a healthy dose of ego, while Jason’s a gifted science student who’s never happier than when he’s working alone in a lab. Caught in an explosion that should have killed them both, the pair were instead fused together into one nuclear-powered being. Bonded through a phenomenon known as the Firestorm Matrix, Ronnie and Jason act together as a single super hero, with Ronnie usually in control of Firestorm’s body, while the more cerebral Jason lends support as a secondary consciousness within the Matrix. Ronnie and Jason have learned to separate at will, returning to their normal forms and capabilities. But when they’re bonded and utilizing the power of the Matrix, Firestorm can fly, absorb radiation, and fire highly destructive blasts of energy from his hands. He possesses immense strength and can rearrange inorganic objects into other shapes or objects—provided he knows their atomic makeup. This last requirement is one of the many reasons that Jason’s contributions are so important, but that doesn’t mean it’s always smooth sailing. In fact, with such different personalities, the two frequently clash both inside and out of the Firestorm Matrix. As a result, Firestorm remains one of the more unpredictable and volatile heroes out there, as well as one of the most dangerous, since too much internal friction could cause a nuclear explosion. But when they do work together, Jason and Ronnie can accomplish great things. Firestorm can quite literally change the world for the better, provided the two young men powering him can only agree on how.",

	"details": "Before her descent into madness, Dr. Harleen Quinzel was a promising psychiatrist assigned to Arkham Asylum, Gotham's home for the criminally insane. But after meeting the Joker, the young doctor became obsessed with the crazed criminal's warped mind. Sensing opportunity, the Joker manipulated her, driving his therapist so mad that he was able to control her. Harleen fell in love with the villain, broke him out of Arkham and devoted her life to making him happy and spreading his bloody brand of mayhem. Athletic, agile and dangerously unpredictable in a fight, Harley Quinn is a formidable opponent in her own right. She is willing to do anything in order to further the Clown Prince of Crime's goals—no matter the cost to anyone else or even herself. Her energetic, affable and animated personality is enough to make almost anyone drop their guard—a mistake that could easily cost them their life. Deranged and psychotic, Harley Quinn is the poster girl for chaos' terrifying allure.",

It’s just that in a city like Gotham, to uphold the law, you sometimes have to be willing to break it.At least, that’s how Detective Harvey Bullock sees it. A good cop worn down by the corruption of Gotham, Bullock may appear slovenly or even oafish, but don’t be fooled. He’s a smart man, dedicated to solving crimes. He just knows that in this city, sometimes to solve a crime you need to cross the line. Whether it’s taking a bribe, roughing up a perp or forging ties with organized crime, Bullock is more than willing to bend the rules to keep the people of Gotham safe and put the truly dangerous criminals behind bars.Even though he may operate in a decidedly gray area, Bullock has righteous intentions. He's loyal to the job and Commissioner Gordon, and has a begrudging respect for Batman. Bullock's willingness to push the boundaries of ethics in favor of getting results to benefit the greater good has proven effective, but it's dangerous territory. He must exercise caution to ensure he doesn't go too far and lose his way. Otherwise, this cop, who has devoted his life to upholding the law, may just find himself on the wrong side of it.",

The metal, coupled with a synthetic pair of wings, allows Hawkgirl to fly and also grants her enhanced strength and the ability to heal more quickly from injury. In battle, she wields swords and maces forged from the mysterious alloy, which allow her to disrupt magic and deflect blasts of energy.  However, regardless of her weapons powerful properties, Shayera is an expert warrior and is incredibly deadly with her trusty mace. Shayera is dedicated to the pursuit of justice and uses all of her skills and abilities to battle those that would harm the innocent. Her penchant for violence honed growing up on her home planet often makes other heroes and law enforcement from Earth uneasy. Yet despite her warlike nature, Hawkgirl is viewed by both friend and foe as a warrior for justice that will protect the planet and its people with her very life.",

However, fascination quickly turned into obsession, and Rory set fire to his family's farmhouse...with them still inside, watching as the flames engulfed everything. As he grew older, his obsession grew stronger and he continued to set fires wherever he went. After getting to know many of the other villains of Central City and seeing how they operated, Rory created a fireproof suit and handgun-size flamethrower capable of reaching extreme levels of heat. With these, Rory moved from a simple arsonist to a super-villain—Heat Wave. Although he faced the Flash a number of times on his own, Heat Wave eventually joined the ranks of Captain Cold's Rogues, quickly becoming one of the criminal organization’s most prominent members. Heat Wave is capable of creating flames so hot that he can instantaneously reduce anything flammable around him to ash and liquefy metal. He works regularly with the Rogues, but unlike the other members of the group who follow a code, Heat Wave's only goal is to watch things burn—making him the most disturbed and dangerous of all the Rogues.",

As the Flash, Jay battled many super-criminals and saved the world alongside his friends numerous times. But he forever changed not only his world, but all worlds when he met his Earth-1 counterpart, Barry Allen. This famous meeting of the Flash of Two Worlds bridged the gap between realities and led to many team-ups, alignments and friendships between the heroes of both Earths. Together, the Flashes would join forces to battle Zoom, the Reverse-Flash, and many other super-villains.By tapping into the extra-dimensional Speed Force, Jay can move at speeds approaching the speed of light. This power also allows him to have faster than normal reflexes and grants him the ability to vibrate fast enough to obscure his features, preventing the need for him to wear a mask. His experience, compassion and kindness have led him to become a mentor to not only future generations of speedsters, but to countless other heroes throughout the DC Universe.",

Both were created by a great tragedy, but Batman has since vowed to do whatever it takes to prevent similar incidents, the Joker revels in creating chaos and destroying lives, believing that life’s a big joke and psychotically demonstrating that in a moment, it can all change.Not much is known about his past, but his acts during the present are what define the Joker as one of the greatest threats to our heroes and the people they've sworn to protect. He's killed a Robin, crippled Batgirl, and tortured and murdered countless people throughout the DC Universe—all just for a laugh.",

She has served as a member of the Outsiders, Birds of Prey, the Suicide Squad and most recently, the Justice League of America under Colonel Steve Trevor and Amanda Waller.Despite her commitment to her heroic duties, Katana still seeks to free the souls trapped her in sword, attempting to resolve their personal conflicts in order to grant them peace—desperately hoping one day the soul she frees will be that of her husband so he may finally be at rest.",

		"details": "As he grew older, Waylon became bitter, developing into a violent and malevolent criminal and adopting a fearful name that matched his frightening appearance—Killer Croc. Waylon managed to engineer a career path that took him from sideshow wrestler to a formidable criminal figure in the Gotham City underworld, often finding himself at violent odds with Batman. And yet, perhaps because of his childhood, Waylon has a soft spot for abandoned and neglected children. He shelters many within his territory in the sewers of Gotham, something that has not gone unnoticed by the Dark Knight, who has demonstrated a bit more leniency with Croc over the years than with most of Gotham’s rogues.Killer Croc possesses the traits of a crocodile in human form. His scaly skin is impenetrable and can deflect blows and bullets. His affliction affects his mind, too, meaning he’s sometimes driven by animal instinct that isn’t exactly rational. Super strength and endurance help him overpower his enemies, as does his sizable physique. And just forget about trying to beat him in a swimming match. Often, Croc's brutish behavior overrules sense, so if you do ever see him, we suggest backing away slowly and praying that he’s not hungry…",

And when it comes to unlimited power, Frost will kill anyone in her way to get it.Killer Frost’s ability to figuratively and literally chill anyone to the bone and her wanton disregard of life make her an incredibly dangerous foe—one who not only wants to kill but also takes pleasure in doing so.",

With super-strength, flight, super-speed and more, Krypto assists Superman in his battle against evil whenever he can and will fight to the death to protect his master from anyone trying to harm him.",

		"details": "A self-made man whose immeasurable intellect is always in conflict with his equally immeasurable ego, Lex Luthor is one of the world's most brilliant minds and most famous villains. From a young age, Lex utilized his almost unparalleled acumen to build himself a financial empire through hard work and dedication—but mainly through the strategic use of intimidation, bribery and murder. Sacrificing other people became simply a means to an end on the path to success, but Luthor always made sure none of his deplorable acts could be traced back to him. Instead, his climb to power and rise in status made him someone to look up to, someone people wanted to emulate—and he relished in the adoration.Until it all changed the day Superman appeared and gave the world something else to aspire to.Driven by jealousy masked with hate over what he perceives to be his stolen place as humanity's true savior, Luthor constantly attempts to destroy and humiliate Superman at every possible opportunity. He's willing to lie, cheat, steal, manipulate and go to any extreme necessary to accomplish his goals, not caring one bit about who he hurts. He is a man who not only wants to be seen as a god, but who has convinced himself he's the only one this worlds needs.",

		"details": "Lobo was born on the utopian planet of Czarnia. Unfortunately for them, the foul-mouth brawler’s idea of a perfect world is one covered in bruises and blood. He wiped out his entire civilization and made himself the last of his people. Considering his name means , he who devours your entrails and thoroughly enjoys it in his native tongue, perhaps they shouldn’t have been too surprised. Lobo took his predilection for murder and mayhem along with his rocket-fueled motorcycle and went on to become the best bounty hunter in the galaxy.Lobo looks out for himself first and foremost, and is never without a plan to cash in at other people’s expense. Though he’s glad to use weapons, Lobo doesn't really need them. His super-strength means his fists are made for bashing. Couple that with his advanced healing powers and unquenchable thirst for blood, and he’s proven to be an incredibly difficult foe to stop—unless you can trick him into entering into a deal. Mercenary or not, Lobo always keeps his word…though he’s not above getting creative in his interpretation of “true to his promise.” As an intergalactic bounty hunter, Lobo's gigs take him all over the universe, but he never lingers for long because there's always someone or something else to apprehend, preferably as painfully as possible.",

Because while she may have spent years trying to beat her colleague Clark Kent to get the byline, she’s also spent those same years in one of the great love stories for the ages. The tale of the god who loved a mortal is as timeless as mythology itself, but Superman and Lois gave it a 20th Century spin that still resonates into the 21st. A role model, an icon and a hero without a cape, Lois Lane has been an eyewitness to history, and through her perseverance and reporting, has opened hearts and minds—not the least of which belongs to the Man of Steel. Love may sometimes have blinded her to the obvious, that Clark and Superman are one and the same. But it’s that same love that has continued to be one of the greatest sources of strength for Kal-El, by helping him to become the most human alien.",

It’s ironic, then, that within the DC Universe, very few people embody those very human traits quite as well as J’onn J’onzz, the Martian Manhunter.A former police officer and family man on his home planet of Mars, J’onn’s life was shaped by great tragedy after witnessing horrific fires that engulfed and destroyed his people and planet—leaving him the lone survivor of his race. Grieving for his family and world, J’onn made Earth his new residence, quickly becoming one of the universe’s most powerful protectors and a key asset for the JLA.Possessing a unique set of powers and abilities, Martian Manhunter rivals even Superman when it comes to his capabilities. Incredible strength, flight, shape-shifting, invisibility, telepathy, telekinesis, extensive wisdom, powerful optic blasts… Martian Manhunter is a force to be reckoned with. Yet for all of his power and wisdom, this near-immortal is still troubled by that which destroyed his world—fire. Though it continues to haunt him, he has learned to channel his fear and transform it into resilience, one of mankind’s greatest traits. Shaped by tragedy and driven by a desire to prevent his planet’s fate from happening to Earth, Martian Manhunter continues to prove that there’s much we can learn from this uniquely human hero.",

His disdain toward those with super powers led to him growing more and more ruthless and manipulative, and eventually he helped form the Justice League International. He believed that the best way to watch over super heroes was to control them, and that he was the only man trustworthy enough and capable enough for the job. With this power, Lord grew to become one of the greatest threats to the DC Universe. Eventually he gained mind-control capabilities, and once even took control of the Man of Steel himself, sending Superman on a rampage.Maxwell Lord’s ability to control another person's mind extends far beyond the capabilities of most with similar powers, going so far as being able to maintain control after an individual realizes they are being controlled. However, the more he uses his powers, the greater the toll on his body—ranging from a simple nosebleed to, possibly, a fatal brain hemorrhage. Despite the countless lives he's taken in his quest to rid the world of super-powered individuals, Lord sees himself as the real hero. Because in his mind—ironically twisted and corrupted by power—they are the real threat, not him.",

Mera knew that to do this, she’d have to gain Aquaman’s trust. It was the only way she could get close enough to kill him. But as she got to know Aquaman, something unexpected occurred—she fell in love. And thus began the fiery redhead's constantly conflicted sense of being. To stand beside her husband is to betray her family and her people, but to give them what they want, to fulfill her mission, is something her heart would never allow her to do.Although a hero in her own right, Mera often finds herself struggling between two worlds—whether it’s between her own people and her husband or between those of the surface and those of the sea. Her aggressive nature especially puts her at odds with the surface world, a world so much bigger and more complex than she was ever taught and with whom she finds it impossible to relate to and understand. It’s for her love of Aquaman that she even attempts to understand this world of man, and why she continues to try to be a part of both worlds while terrified of belonging to none.",

However, peace came at a price. Sinestro's determination to preserve order caused him to act more as a dictator than a protector, conquering his own home planet in the process. Control became his means to an end, the true path to order in both his sector and the universe as a whole, and Sinestro did anything necessary to achieve it. It wasn't until then new recruit Hal Jordan learned of Sinestro's methods that the Guardians were informed and Sinestro was ejected from the Corps.Steadfast in his belief of moral superiority and methods of maintaining order, Sinestro formed the Sinestro Corps, harnessing the yellow energy of fear, to not only combat the Guardians, whom he sees as the main obstacle on the path to intergalactic peace, but to also strengthen the Green Lantern Corps. For it is Sinestro’s opinion that the Green Lanterns have long since been held back by their creators.Highly intelligent with an almost unbreakable will, Thaal Sinestro will do anything to achieve control and thereby order—control over his emotions, control over others, and even control over the entire universe.",

		"details": "Hunter Zolomon's life was riddled by brutal tragedies. As a child, he discovered his father was a serial killer who also murdered Hunter's mother after she tried to stop him. This tragedy inspired Hunter to study psychology and criminology, and to join the FBI; but a miscalculation during a case led to the death of his father-in-law. Then, things took a turn for the truly dark after an attack by Gorilla Grodd left Hunter paralyzed. He begged his friend the Flash to go back in time and prevent the attack from happening—and the Flash refused.Taking matters into his own hands, Hunter attempted to go back in time himself, leading to an accidental explosion, another tragedy—but one that made him more than what he was. Gaining the ability of perceived super-speed and adopting the name Zoom, Hunter dedicated his life to making sure people experienced their own personal tragedy in order to make them better heroes—starting with the Flash.Zoom is utterly unlike the Flash and other speedsters, both setting him apart and making him one of the most dangerous and challenging of Flash’s foes. His speed doesn’t come from the Speed Force, but from altering his own relative time, slowing or speeding up the world around him, allowing him to run even faster than the Flash. His warped sense of heroism and villainy has led Zoom to continuously threaten not only those closest to the Flash but also countless heroes throughout the DC Universe. But really, he's just trying to make them better…by any means necessary.",
